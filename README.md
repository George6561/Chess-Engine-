## Introduction

This **Chess Engine** project is designed to provide users with an advanced chess-playing experience using the Stockfish engine for AI-based moves and calculations. The project is written in Java and makes use of Maven for project management and dependency handling.

The project includes:
- A simple chess game interface built in Java.
- Integration with the Stockfish chess engine.
- A command-line interface for easy play.
- The ability to evaluate chess positions and generate moves using Stockfish.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

Chess2/ ├── src/ # Source files for the Chess game ├── stockfish/ # Stockfish engine files ├── target/ # Compiled files and Maven outputs ├── pom.xml # Maven project configuration file


- **`src/`**: Contains the Java source code for the chess engine and user interface.
- **`stockfish/`**: Contains Stockfish executables and scripts for interaction with the Java code.
- **`target/`**: Maven's output directory for compiled classes and dependencies.
- **`pom.xml`**: The Project Object Model file for Maven, which handles dependencies and build configuration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java 8 or higher**: Ensure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java 8 or higher**: Ensure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **Maven**: Used for building and managing project dependencies.
- **Git**: To clone the repository and manage version control.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/George6561/Chess-Engine-.git cd Chess-Engine-
2. Use Maven to install the necessary dependencies and build the project:
mvn clean install

This command will compile the project, download any required dependencies, and prepare the environment for execution.

3. If you haven't installed **Stockfish** already, you'll need to download the appropriate version for your system. It's already included in the `stockfish/` directory of the project, but ensure you have the correct executable for your platform.

## Setup

### Running the Chess Engine

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project (`Chess2/`).
2. You can execute the chess engine from the command line with the following Maven command:
mvn exec
-Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
Replace `"com.example.Main"` with the actual class that contains the `main()` method of your Java chess engine.

3. You can also integrate Stockfish directly with the chess interface by running the engine from the `stockfish` directory.

### Stockfish Integration

The project includes the **Stockfish** engine for advanced chess calculations. Stockfish helps evaluate board positions and generate moves for the AI opponent.

- If using the Stockfish engine manually, navigate to the `stockfish/` folder, and run the Stockfish executable from the command line:
./stockfish

In the chess game code, the moves will be evaluated and processed by Stockfish in the background.

## Usage

### Play Against the Chess AI

Once the game starts, the player can make moves using a simple text-based or graphical interface, depending on how the project is set up. Moves are typically entered using algebraic notation (e.g., `e2 e4` for pawn to e4).

The AI opponent, powered by Stockfish, will respond with its own calculated moves. You can configure the difficulty level of Stockfish in the settings.

### Command-Line Interface

The project supports a basic command-line interface for playing chess. Once the engine is running, you can interact with it through commands like:
- `move <from> <to>`: Make a move from one square to another (e.g., `move e2 e4`).
- `undo`: Undo the last move.
- `resign`: Resign from the game.

Introduction
This Chess Engine project is designed to provide users with an advanced chess-playing experience using the Stockfish engine for AI-based moves and calculations. The project is written in Java and makes use of Maven for project management and dependency handling.

The project includes:

A simple chess game interface built in Java.
Integration with the Stockfish chess engine.
A command-line interface for easy play.
The ability to evaluate chess positions and generate moves using Stockfish.
Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

src/: Contains the Java source code for the chess engine and user interface.
stockfish/: Contains Stockfish executables and scripts for interaction with the Java code.
target/: Maven's output directory for compiled classes and dependencies.
pom.xml: The Project Object Model file for Maven, which handles dependencies and build configuration.
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Java 8 or higher: Ensure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Maven: Used for building and managing project dependencies.
Git: To clone the repository and manage version control.
Steps to Install
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to it.
Use Maven to install the necessary dependencies and build the project. This command will compile the project, download any required dependencies, and prepare the environment for execution.
If you haven't installed Stockfish already, you'll need to download the appropriate version for your system. It's already included in the stockfish/ directory of the project, but ensure you have the correct executable for your platform.
Setup
Running the Chess Engine
Navigate to the root directory of the project (Chess2/).
You can execute the chess engine from the command line using Maven.
You can also integrate Stockfish directly with the chess interface by running the engine from the stockfish directory.
Stockfish Integration
The project includes the Stockfish engine for advanced chess calculations. Stockfish helps evaluate board positions and generate moves for the AI opponent.

If using the Stockfish engine manually, navigate to the stockfish/ folder and run the Stockfish executable from the command line.

Usage
Play Against the Chess AI
Once the game starts, the player can make moves using a simple text-based or graphical interface, depending on how the project is set up. Moves are typically entered using algebraic notation (e.g., e2 e4 for pawn to e4).

The AI opponent, powered by Stockfish, will respond with its own calculated moves. You can configure the difficulty level of Stockfish in the settings.

Command-Line Interface
The project supports a basic command-line interface for playing chess. Once the engine is running, you can interact with it through commands like:

move <from> <to>: Make a move from one square to another (e.g., move e2 e4).
undo: Undo the last move.
resign: Resign from the game.

Known Issues
Large File Size: The project contains large files, such as the Stockfish engine executable. If these files are too large to be handled directly by Git, consider using Git LFS.
Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the correct version of Stockfish is being used for your operating system.
